== Architecture Checks

=== Cyclic Dependencies

There must be no dependency cycles between modules:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:NoCyclicModuleDependencies"]

There should be no dependency cycles between packages:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:NoCyclicPackageDependencies"]

There must be no dependency cycles between artifacts:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:NoCyclicArtefactDependencies"]

=== Dependency Usage

==== Afferent and efferent module dependencies

Efferent dependencies of modules:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[concepts="architecture:EfferentModuleDependencies"]

Afferent dependencies of modules:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[concepts="architecture:AfferentModuleDependencies"]

==== PicoCLI

Only the `cli` module is allowed to have
dependencies on `picocli`:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:OnlyModuleCliDependesOnPicoCli"]

==== Jsonb/yyson

Only repository classes are allowed to use
JsonbBuilder (and thus are allowed to load JSON files):

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:OnlyRepositoryMayUseJsonbBuilder"]

Outside the repositories only Jsonb annotations are
allowed:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:JsonbAnnotationEveryWhere"]

=== Tests

we should have no deactivated tests:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:NoDeactivatedTests"]
