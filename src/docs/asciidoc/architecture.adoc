=== Cyclic Dependencies

There must be no dependency cycles between modules:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:NoCyclicModuleDependencies", leveloffset=+3]

There should be no dependency cycles between packages:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:NoCyclicPackageDependencies", leveloffset=+3]

There must be no dependency cycles between artifacts:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:NoCyclicArtefactDependencies", leveloffset=+3]

=== Dependency Usage

=== Afferent and efferent module dependencies

Efferent dependencies of modules:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[concepts="architecture:EfferentModuleDependencies", leveloffset=+3]

Afferent dependencies of modules:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[concepts="architecture:AfferentModuleDependencies", leveloffset=+3]

==== PicoCLI

Only the `cli` module is allowed to have
dependencies on `picocli`:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:OnlyModuleCliDependesOnPicoCli", leveloffset=+3]

==== Jsonb/yyson

Only repository classes are allowed to use
JsonbBuilder (and thus are allowed to load JSON files):

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:OnlyRepositoryMayUseJsonbBuilder", leveloffset=+4]

Outside the repositories only Jsonb annotations are
allowed:

include::jQAssistant:Rules[constraints="architecture:JsonbAnnotationEveryWhere", leveloffset=+4]

=== Tests

we should have no deactivated tests:
